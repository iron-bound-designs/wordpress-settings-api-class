What is this?
---------------

This is a fork of [WeDevs Settings API Class](https://github.com/tareq1988/wordpress-settings-api-class) that utilizes PHP 5.3 features and makes a couple of other small adjustments.

It's a PHP class wrapper for handling WordPress [Settings API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API). Gives a very handy way to build theme or plugins option panel.
